# ClockSandbox

**Python infrastructure for simulating prototype clocks — from ideal models with tunable noise to global systems including GPS, VLBI Earth rotation, and pulsar timing.**

---

## Overview

**ClockSandbox** provides a modular environment to explore the physics, statistics, and network interactions of clocks across scales — from laboratory prototypes to astrophysical timekeepers.

The goal is to establish a **computational and conceptual sandbox** to test ideas about time measurement, stability, and synchronization:
- **Prototype clocks** with ideal and noisy oscillators
- **Noise models** (white, flicker, random walk, and custom spectra)
- **Networked clocks** with adaptive trust weights and feedback
- **External references** (GPS satellite timing, VLBI Earth rotation data, pulsar timing archives)

Ultimately, this sandbox aims to connect **quantum**, **geodetic**, and **astrophysical** clocks as complementary pillars of a metrological description of spacetime.

## Features (Planned)

- 🕰️ Modular `Clock` base class with selectable noise processes  
- 📈 Allan deviation, PSD, and correlation analysis tools  
- 🌍 Access layer for live GNSS and VLBI feeds (optional modules)  
- 🌌 Synthetic pulsar timing models and injected noise sequences  
- 🤝 Clock network simulation (trust weighting, consensus, resilience)  
- 📚 Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations and tutorials

## Vision

> *From quantum oscillators to cosmic beacons — exploring how clocks define and connect spacetime.*

The long-term vision is to establish an open, extensible platform where the community can model, analyze, and compare clocks as **physical systems**, **information sources**, and **metrological anchors**.  
ClockSandbox is an early step toward that foundation.
